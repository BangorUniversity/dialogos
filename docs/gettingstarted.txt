Getting started
===============

This document is designed to get you up and running with dialogos, which is a
comments app that works with ``django-flag`` to provide flagging capabilities.


Prerequisites
=============

These are the requirements to run dialogos:

 * Python **2.4+** (Python 3.x is **not** supported yet)
 * Django **1.2+**


Installation
============

To install dialogos use pip_:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install dialogos flag

Add dialogos to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "flag",
        "dialogos",
    ]

Hook up dialogos to your URLconf:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns("",
        # ...
        url(r"^comments/", include("dialogos.urls"))
    )

This is largely all you need to do to get dialogos setup in your project.
Continue reading on to learn more about how to use dialogos.


Usage
=====

To use comments, you basically just need to make appropriate use of template
tags in your templates.

First, you need to load the template tags::

    {% load dialogos_tags %}

Like Django's built in comments, ``dialogos`` comments are attached to an object
in your project.


``get_comment_count``
---------------------

Gets the comment count for a particular object::

    {% get_comment_count for post as comment_count %}


``get_comment_list``
--------------------

Gets the list of comments for particular object::

    {% get_comment_list for post as comment_list %}
    <ul>
    {% for comment in comment_list %}
        {{ comment.comment }} by {{ comment.author|default:comment.name }}
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>


``get_comment_form``
--------------------

Gets the comment form for a particular object::

    {% get_comment_form for post as form %}
    
    <form action="{% url dialogos_form_target %}" method="POST">
      {% csrf_token %}
      {{ form }}
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><input type="submit" name="preview" class="submit-post" value="Preview"></td>
      </tr>
    </form>
