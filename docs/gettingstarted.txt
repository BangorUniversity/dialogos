Getting started
===============

This document is designed to get you up and running with dialogos, which is a
comments app that works with ``django-flag`` to provide flagging capabilities.


Prerequisites
=============

These are the requirements to run dialogos:

 * Python **2.4+** (Python 3.x is **not** supported yet)
 * Django **1.2+**


Installation
============

To install dialogos use pip_:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install dialogos flag

Add dialogos to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "flag",
        "dialogos",
    ]

Hook up dialogos to your URLconf:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns("",
        # ...
        url(r"^comments/", include("dialogos.urls"))
    )

This is largely all you need to do to get dialogos setup in your project.
